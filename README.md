About the Project  
The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a critical metric that reflects air pollution levels. This project uses Python for analyzing and visualizing AQI data to gain meaningful insights into air quality trends across India.  

Objectives:  
- Understand the distribution of AQI levels over time.  
- Identify trends and anomalies in air quality.  
- Create visualizations to present findings effectively.  

---
Features  
- Data Cleaning: Preprocessing raw data to ensure consistency and accuracy.  
- Data Analysis: Statistical analysis of AQI trends.  
- Visualization: Charts and maps to make data-driven insights visually compelling.  
- Insights: Highlighting areas of concern and trends in air quality.  

---
Technologies Used  
This project leverages the following Python libraries:  
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.  
- Matplotlib: For creating static visualizations.  
- Seaborn: For advanced statistical data visualization.  
- Folium: For interactive maps.  
- NumPy: For numerical operations.  
- Sweetviz: For exploratory data analysis (EDA).
